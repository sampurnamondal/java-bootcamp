/**
 * You need to write a simple Java program to check if a given String is palindrome or not. 
 * A Palindrome is a String which is equal to the reverse of itself, e.g., "Bob" is a palindrome because of the reverse of "Bob" is also "Bob."  
 * Though be prepared with both recursive and iterative solution of this problem. 
 * The interviewer may ask you to solve without using any library method, e.g. indexOf() or subString() so be prepared for that.
